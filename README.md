# Fwish-Flask 

## How to run the Fwish app??

### Step -- > First we have to set up the environment after cloning, to achieve that run the command `virtualenv env` and `pip install virtualenv` 
### Optional but maybe a mandatory step -- > Maybe your pc wont allow some scripts so run the command `Set-ExecutionPolicy unrestricted` on admin command panel 
### Step --> Now run the command `.\env\Scripts\activate.ps1`
### Step -- > Run `pip install flask` in the same folder
### Step -- > Run  `python app.py` in the same folder and see the app running on `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`
